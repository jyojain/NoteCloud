    <h4>Notecloud</h4>
    <p>When thinking about a project for CPSC 454, our group asked ourselves what is something important to college students? Obviously, note-taking is crucial for learning and material retention. However, since we are transitioning to an increasingly heavy dependency on technology, we believed there is a need for college students to possess a tool which converted handwritten notes to typed text. This website allows students to sign on and upload their notes to AWS Cloud. The AWS backend features the use of numerous built in AWS services: AWS Textract, S3, Cognito, Amplify, and SNS. These applications will work together to deliver the highest performance and availability for our users.</p>
